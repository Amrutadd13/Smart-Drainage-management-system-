# Smart-Drainage-management-system-
An IoT-based smart drainage monitoring system using Arduino UNO, ultrasonic sensor, backend email notification, and digital twin dashboard.

## Features

- Real-time water level monitoring
- Risk classification (SAFE / WARNING / HIGH)
- Automatic email notification to authorities
- Digital twin dashboard with live graph
- Alert reset logic to prevent spam

## Technologies Used

- Arduino UNO
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Python Flask Backend
- SMTP Email Notification
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Chart.js for visualization

## How It Works

Arduino sends water level data to backend.
Backend checks threshold and sends email alert.
Digital twin dashboard displays live water level graph.

## Future Improvements

- Gas sensor integration
- Google Maps heatmap
- Cloud deployment
- AI-based prediction
